# Overview

I was worried about security for some of my files and so I wanted to implement a code that could encode it and decode it.

The purpose of writing this software is to demonstrate how to implement basic file encryption and decryption functionality using C#. With the increasing importance of data security, it's critical to understand how to protect sensitive information stored in files.

I was unable to record a video for this one.

# Development Environment

To develop the software, I primarily used Visual Studio

The programming language I used to develop the software is C#. C# is a powerful, versatile language that is part of the .NET framework. In this case, I utilized C# to implement file encryption and decryption functionality.Additionally, I made use of the .NET framework's built-in cryptographic libraries for implementing the AES encryption algorithm.

# Future Work

What I need to fix and improve as I work more on the code

Fixes in the future:

1. Improve error handling: Implement more robust error handling to gracefully handle exceptions and edge cases.

2. Enhance security: Explore additional encryption algorithms or techniques to further enhance data security.

3. Address performance issues: Optimize the code for better performance, especially for handling large files.

Improvements:

1. User interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the tool more user-friendly and intuitive.

2. File integrity checks: Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of encrypted files to detect tampering.
